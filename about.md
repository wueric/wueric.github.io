---

I am a currently a fourth-year undergraduate at [UC Berkeley](http://berkeley.edu) in the [Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu).  In Fall 2016, I will be beginning my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering at [Stanford University](http://http://ee.stanford.edu/).

## Affiliations

* I currently work on developing novel wearable biosensing systems in [Professor Ali Javey's research group](http://nano.eecs.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley.
* In the past, I worked on developing data analysis and visualization tools for studying RNA alternative splicing in [Professor Stephen Montgomery's research group](http://montgomerylab.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University.
